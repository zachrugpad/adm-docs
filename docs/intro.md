# American Digital Marketing <br/> Marketplace API

## Overview

Welcome to the American Digital Marketing (ADM) Marketplace API documentation. This API is designed to facilitate seamless integration between our order management systems and your fulfillment systems, ensuring efficient communication and processing of e-commerce sales generated by the ADM platform.

## Webhooks

A webhook is an event message that's delivered to your application using HTTPS. Webhooks allow our merchants to stay in sync with ADM data or perform an action after a specific event occurs (Order Creation, Cancelation, Return, etc.). Webhooks are a performant alternative to continuously polling.

For example, a webhook can notify your application when a customer places an order for your one or more of your products on one of our marketplaces. Your system can, in turn, initiate shipment of those order lines.

ADM encourages the utilization of webhook subscriptions for all its outbound data.

### Webhook Topic

Webhooks are organized into topics. Your application subscribes to one topic per merchant to receive webhooks each time that type of event is triggered for your merchant on the ADM platform. The topic defines the kind of event messages that the app receives. For example, your app can subscribe to the `orders/create` topic to be notified when an order is created that contains any of your products.

Topics have a name that identifies the nature of the event that's triggered.

### Webhook Subscription

A webhook subscription declares your application’s intention to receive webhooks for a topic. A subscription includes the topic and the subscription endpoint, which is the HTTPS destination (URL) where ADM sends webhooks.

For example, whenever an `orders/create` event occurs, an event message (payload) is delivered to the endpoint your application set up as the destination when it subscribed.

## Endpoints

As described in the webhook section above, endpoints are HTTPS destinations where an event message can be sent. Endpoints are used by merchants not only to receive event messages from ADM but also to send POST requests to. As such, ADM has created a library of endpoints that can be used to automatically provide ADM with real-time data.

For example, after a fulfillment is created for an item sold on an ADM marketplace, using the `fulfillments` resource, your application can POST to the `fulfillments/create` endpoint.

Marketplace API endpoints are organized by resource type. All requests produce HTTP response status codes.

## Authentication
ADM utilizes secret tokens to authenticate the messages sent to and received by our partners. Please take precautions not to share or expose these tokens to anyone without a required role or permission. If any token becomes compromised, a new token can be generated for your application upon request.

### Webhooks
When subscribing to an ADM Webhook, you will be provided with a `webhook token` that is specific to your application and can be used for all subscriptions. Each webhook request includes a signature in the HTTP header `X-ADM-Webhook-Signature`. This signature is generated using the HMAC-SHA-256 hashing algorithm.

Your application can compare this `webhook signature` to a hashed version of the message body (created with your `webhook token`) to validate the authenticity of the message.

### Endpoints
All REST Marketplace API queries require a valid ADM `access token`. During the testing phase of your application’s integration into the ADP platform, an ADM `access token` will be provided.

Include your token as a `X-ADM-Access-Token` header on all API queries.
